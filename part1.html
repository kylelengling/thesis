					Being prepared to commute is the best way to start! It's no fun going into it blind and having a miserable time because you were ill prepared or got lost.
				</p>
				<p class="callout">
					So start by checking out <a href="gear.html">the bare essentials</a> and making sure you have everything to get you there and back safely! A quick list would include: a bike (duh), lock, lights, and helmet. Those will get you there and back safely. Everything beyond that just makes the ride that much easier.
				</p>
				<p class="callout">
					So you've got the basic gear gathered. Awesome! Let's take a moment and think about how to commute. I know it's scary and a daunting task, but really it'll all be fine! The first thing you'll want to open your favorite map or mapping website. <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> is pretty great for this. Use the map to plan out a route you'll take to your destination. Important factors to consider, traffic, traffic speed, stoplights, bike lanes and other infrastructure. Sometimes the best route isn't the most direct. 
				</p>
				<p class="callout">
					Take this time to really consider everything you'll need to do. Does your office have showers you can change in? Are you bringing clothes or leaving a bunch at work? Are you bringing a lunch in your bag? Get used to the idea of carrying most if not all the things you'll need in a backpack or panniers.
